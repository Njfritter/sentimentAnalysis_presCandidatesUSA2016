# sentimentAnalysis_presCandidatesUSA2016

ABSTRACT

This project focuses on classifying tweets (source: [twitter](https://twitter.com)) of the 2016 candidates for presidency to the United States: Hillary Clinton (Democrat) and Donald Trump (Republican) into two classes: positive or negative. Natural language processing (NLP) is used in the context of the Python programming language -- we focus on leveraging the [NLTK package](http://www.nltk.org/).

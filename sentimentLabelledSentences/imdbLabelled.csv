"703","This is high adventure at its best.","Positive"
"704","I think it was Robert Ryans best film, because he portrayed someone like my father, and he was a schizophrenic in real life,(my father) although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse.","Positive"

"747","1/10 - and only because there is no setting for 0/10.","Negative"
"748","An interesting premise, and Billy Drago is always good as a dangerous nut-bag (side note: I'd love to see Drago, Stephen McHattie and Lance Hendrikson in a flick together, talk aboraging cheekbones!).","Positive"
"749","The soundtrack wasn't terrible, either.","Positive"
"750","But the acting--even that of such professionals as Drago and Debbie Rochon--was terrible, the directing worse (perhaps contributory to the former), the dialog chimp-like, and the camera work, barely tolerable.","Negative"
"751","Still, it was the SETS that got a big 10 on my oy-vey scale.","Positive"
"752","Yes, I am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity, for this really is at the core of the problems with this film - "\it has too much going on without any real, fulfilling explanation.","Negative"

"782","A cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation, lots of underbite style stoic emoting (think Chow Yun Fat in A Better Tomorrow) and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la John Woo.","Negative"
"783","Even the squibs look awful.","Negative"
"784","At no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like America.","Negative"
"785","The plot, such as it is, is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing.","Negative"
"786","The awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time.","Negative"
"787","I was very uneasy with how bad this movie was, but not scared at all.","Negative"
"788","The dialogue is composed of things that make little sense.","Negative"
"789","About 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudo-Satanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen Goth blush, almost always in Olde English, and sometimes in Latin that may or may not be made up words.","Negative"

"792","Of course, the acting is blah.","Negative"

"900","Is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this?","Negative"
"901","There is no plot here to keep you going in the first place.","Negative"
"902","Even when the women finally show up, there is no sign of improvement, the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over, you might be far asleep.","Negative"
"903","Beware: this is not a trashy cult movie, this is trash -period!","Negative"
"904","I can't believe there's even a sequel to this!","Negative"
"905","Which is precisely why I am giving it such a bad review!","Negative"
"906","Being a 90's child, I truly enjoyed this show and I can proudly say that I enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical WB cartoons.","Positive"
"907","But Tiny Toons kept the 90's vibe and delivered one of the most popular, funny, and underrated cartoons ever created.","Positive"
"908","The memories are murky but I can only say that I enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show.","Positive"
"909","Easily, none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way (before getting into dark sitcoms orient for teenagers).","Positive"
"910","The characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character.","Positive"
"911","Every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead.","Positive"
"912","Every element of this story was so over the top, excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through.","Negative"
"913","Her lines seem to have been WRITTEN by a fifteen year old, though they are trying oh so, so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really, um, you know, well... talk.","Negative"
"914","Perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera.","Positive"
"915","There is simply no excuse for something this poorly done.","Negative"
"916","I saw this movie and I thought this is a stupid movie.","Negative"
"917","What is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in Los Angeles?","Negative"
"918","To be honest with you, this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish.","Negative"
"919","In conclusion, I will not bother with this movie because a volcano in Los Angeles is nothing but nonsense.","Negative"
"920","The story line is just awful!","Negative"
"921","It's just painful!","Negative"

"923","There's also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit.","Negative"
"924","Don't waste your time watching this rubbish non-researched film.","Negative"
"925","I believe that Pitch Black was done well.","Positive"

"932","An instant classic, with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits.","Positive"
"933","Don't miss it.","Positive"
"934","This is a masterful piece of film-making, with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poet's bohemian, self-indulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of London and the outward tranquillity of a Welsh coastal retreat - the borderlines between friendship, lust and love, dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns, jealousy, rivalry, cowardice and egotism versus heroism and self-sacrifice and more.","Positive"
"935","A mature, subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances (apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that Keira Knightley is prone to, though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves oftmention it).","Positive"
"936","But above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment, with inventive and elegant use of close-up, camera angle and lighting, including pointillistic faux home movie footage, is a wonder and joy to behold.","Positive"
"937","It's as continuously beautiful to look at as a Bertolucci, but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that master's work.","Positive"
"938","The basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew.","Negative"
"939","Regardless, the film fails on most levels.","Negative"
"940","Avoid at all costs.","Negative"

"945","But it wasn't until I watched this film that I realised how great he actually was.","Positive"
"946","I'll give this film 10 out of 10!","Positive"
"947","I know that Jim O'Connor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him, but George was well dull.","Negative"
"948","He really didn't seem to want to be hosting, his voice-overs were monotonous, didn't get involved with the guests.","Negative"
"949","Lovely little thriller from Hitchcock, with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy, a kidnapped child, a nasty church, a foreign plot and some random taxidermists.","Positive"
"950","Jimmy Stewart is as ever a great hero for Hitchcock, the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function, but it lacks the brooding menace of Hitchcock's black and white, low-budget original.","Positive"
"951","Nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great master's stable.","Positive"
"952","I have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film!","Positive"

"962","This movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing South Africa.","Positive"

"970","Very true to Shakespear, and a 'must' for all Shakespear fans.","Positive"
"971","Macbeth (Jason Connery) moved me to tears with his final monolog (out brief candle, out) He gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face, which makes it the more interesting.","Positive"
"972","Helen Baxendale is a very credible lady Macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl, but deadly in her taste for blood and evil.","Positive"
"973","If you love death and decay, and Shakespears lyrics... this is the one.","Positive"

"975","Special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects, which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon.","Positive"
"976","However Paul Schrader has indeed made a film about Mishima that is both superb & complex.","Positive"
"977","Also notable is John Bailey's fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design & costumes by Eiko Ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for Coppola's Dracula for which she received a well deserved Oscar.","Positive"
"978","Even allowing for poor production values for the time (1971) and the format (some kind of mini-series), this is baaaaaad.","Negative"
"979","Unless you're just out to visually collect all extant films of Austen's work, you can skip this one.","Negative"

"981","It is not good.","Negative"
"982","Speaking of the music, it is unbearably predictably and kitchy.","Negative"
"983","Then the film just dropped the ball.","Negative"
"984","This is a stunning movie.","Positive"
"985","Raw and sublimely moving.","Positive"
"986","It felt like a very gripping, intelligent stage play (but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage) which plays on everyone's terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences.","Positive"

"996","Feelings, thoughts...Gabriel's discomfort during the dance...all these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewer's grasp in Huston's portrayal.","Positive"
"997","Very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the Oscar shortlist.","Negative"
"998","It's very slow.","Negative"
"999","Lot of holes in the plot: there's nothing about how he became the emperor, nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age.","Negative"
"1000","Don't waste your time.","Negative"
"1001","End of Days is one of the worst big-budget action movies I've ever seen.","Negative"
